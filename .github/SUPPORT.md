If you'd like to contribute to s3-lambo,
see our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you've found a bug in a [supported version](#supported-versions)
of s3-lambo, please report it with the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/thousandxyz/s3-lambo/issues).

## Supported Versions
The latest *stable* major version is currently supported by the team.
For example, if the latest release is 1.6.y, then the 1.x.y versions are supported.

The latest stable release unilaterally receives all fixes from `master`,
and the version prior to that receives the vast majority of those fixes
as time and bandwidth warrants.

### Currently supported versions

- 1.x.y

### End-of-life
When a release branch reaches the end of its support cycle, the series
will be deprecated in NPM and a final end-of-support release will be
made. This release will add a warning to inform that an unsupported
version of s3-lambo is in use.

These steps are to help developers learn when a branch they're
using becomes unsupported, but without being excessively intrusive
to end users.
