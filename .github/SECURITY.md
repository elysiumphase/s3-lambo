# Security Policy

Our security policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.

The s3-lambo team and community take security bugs in s3-lambo seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Your responsibility is to report vulnerabilities to us using the guidelines outlined below.

To report a security issue please do the following:
* Email [hi@thousand.xyz](mailto:hi@thousand.xyz);
* Include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line;
* Give your name and affiliation (if any);
* Include scope of vulnerability by letting us know who could use this exploit;
* Document steps to identify the vulnerability so we can reproduce your findings;
* Show how to exploit vulnerability, give us an attack scenario.

The s3-lambo team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting *I'm reporting a security vulnerability*.
